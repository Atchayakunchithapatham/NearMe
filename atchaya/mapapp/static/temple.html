A Vishnu temple called Kondandaramaswamy temple exists in Ariyalur. 
Though the presiding deity in this temple is Srinivasaperumal it is popularly called as Kodandaramaswamy kovil because of the existence of a shrine in which Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are enshrined. The portrait sculptures in
 the Dasavaratara mandapa may be that of this Chief and his Queen. The beautiful ornamental workmanship of the adhishtana, kumbapanchara in the sanctum, Dasavatara sculptures and the Gopura â€“ all make this temple as a beautiful centre of the architectural achievements of the Ariyalur Chief.
