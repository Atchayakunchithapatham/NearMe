 The Payaraneeswarar Temple  is located in the place Udayarpalayam which is in Ariyalur District.
 This is one of the oldest Shiva temples dated back to 1400 years. This area was ruled by different kings-Pallavas, Chozhas, Pandyas and Udayars for the last four hundred years. 
Hence it was named Udayarpalayam. . This is a very large temple with a seven tiered rajagopuram.
Another beautiful attraction in the temple is a very large temple tank with a central mandapam in the middle.
